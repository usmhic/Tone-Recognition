# A Comprehensive Guide with a Demonstration of using Generic Algorithms to Detect Tone in Speech Recognition.

Our goal is to kickstart an AI-powered voice recognition application that not only listens to your every command but also interacts with you based on your unique tone. We're not just building an app, we're also on a mission to educate users about the exciting world of voice recognition technology. From the basics to the nitty-gritty, we're breaking down the underlying concepts of voice recognition and showing you how it all comes together in practice.

### The project consists of three main components that are all displayed in the web app:
1. Tone Recognition with Genetic Algorithms: How to Identify Gender & Age from Voice with Genetic Algorithm.
2. Creating a DLL for the Genetic Algorithm: How to Use the Algorithm in Speech AI Model Training.
3. Creating a Web App as Use Case Demonstration: A Web App that Interacts with Users Based on Tone, Powered by OpenAI.
