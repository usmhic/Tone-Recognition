## A Comprehensive Guide & Demonstration of Training Voice Recognition Models with Feature Extraction using Generic Algorithms.

Our goal is to create an application that not only understands your voice commands but also show how the AI-powered voice recognition system works. We're dedicated to providing a comprehensive explanation of the underlying technology.

To get started, we need to figure out what features we need to extract from human speech to train our AI model. We're not doing this alone - we've got a powerful algorithm called a genetic algorithm. This algorithm is going to help us extract important features from speech like pitch and tone. 

We'll be using MATLAB to run this algorithm and create a "dll" that can be used with Blazor, a popular C# and .NET framework. We'll be using our generated dll to demonstrate how the feature extraction works in the WebApp.

To speed things up, we won't be using our generated dll for AI model training. Instead, we'll be using an already trained speech recognition system dll for our web application. The MATLAB dll is just for showing off how the feature extraction process works.
